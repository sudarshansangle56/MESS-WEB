## Project Overview
**MESS-WEB** is a web-based platform designed to assist tiffin service owners in managing their business efficiently. The platform allows users to keep track of customer records, daily orders, and monthly payments tracker interface. It is built using **React.js** for the frontend, **Bootstrap** for responsive design, and **Firebase** for backend services such as authentication and data storage.

As a team project, my primary role was **Frontend Developer**, where I utilized **React** and **Bootstrap** to build the user interface and integrated **Firebase** for authentication and database functionalities.
